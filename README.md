### Project Overview:

We analyze a restaurant focusing primarily on take-out and delivery services, similar to renowned chains like Domino's. To streamline and optimize the operations of his new business, I designed and built a custom relational database. This comprehensive database will serve as the backbone of the pizzeria's data management system, enabling the capture, storage, and analysis of vital information generated by the business.

### Project Objectives:

**Data Capture and Storage:** The database will be designed to efficiently manage data pertaining to customer orders, stock levels, and staff-related information. This meticulous data collection will form the foundation for insightful business analysis.

**Business Performance Monitoring:** Through the effective utilization of the relational database, the pizzeria will have the tools necessary to monitor its business performance in real-time. By leveraging dashboards, the team can gain valuable insights into the key aspects of the business, thereby facilitating informed decision-making.

**Cost and Inventory Management:** A key outcome of this project will be the ability to understand the pizzeria's overall costs and inventory. This understanding will be achieved through data aggregation and visualization tools in Looker Studio, allowing for data-driven decisions to optimize operations.

### Key Areas of Focus:

**Customer Orders:** The database will capture and organize data related to customer orders, including order details, customer information, delivery status, and payment records. This data will enable the pizzeria to enhance customer service, track order trends, and improve order fulfillment.

**Stock Levels:** The stock management component of the database will provide real-time insights into ingredient levels, supplier details, and inventory turnover rates. This information will empower the pizzeria to maintain efficient stock levels, reduce wastage, and manage costs effectively.

**Staff Information:** Staff data, including employee details, work schedules, and performance metrics, will be stored within the database. This will help in workforce management, scheduling, and ensuring that the pizzeria's staffing needs are met efficiently.

### Conclusion:

The creation of a tailor-made relational database for Pizzeria's owner is a pivotal step in ensuring the success and efficiency of the new venture. By capturing, storing, and analyzing data related to customer orders, stock levels, and staff, we aim to provide the foundation for data-driven decision-making and optimization of business performance. This project will be integral in helping the client become a thriving and competitive player in the food service industry.
